title: it's been a long time

Indeed it has!  I haven't written about much of anything Ive done in a good long while.  Recently I've been doing a lot of work learning about [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org) and [Clojure](http://clojure.org).  I am going to update these pages more fully in the next couple of days, but for now, lets just say that functional programming rocks, and surreal numbers are awesome!  Much more to come!
