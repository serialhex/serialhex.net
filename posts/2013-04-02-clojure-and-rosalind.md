In order to effectively learn something new you must use it.  Trying to learn how to ride a bicycle or swim by simply reading stuff on the internet doesn't work (unless your [Sheldon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnKoQbFXemE)).  Thus I needed to find some problem (or set of problems) in order to sharpen my skills... and even simply be able to form my brain to use the tools set before me.

I've decided to use [Project Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/) as my problem set.  Project Rosalind (named after Rosalind Franklin, whose X-ray crystallography with Raymond Gosling facilitated the discovery of the DNA double helix by Watson and Crick (from their [about page](http://rosalind.info/about/))) is a bunch of bioinformatics challenges, so I get to learn both Clojure & bioinformatics.  To make it a bit more challenging I'm going to try to make a comprehensive library out of all the problems.  By no means do I intend it to do truly cool bioinformatics stuff, though if it ends up doing that, so much the better.  My code (as usual) is public & is posted here: <https://github.com/serialhex/rosalind>

...and remember: if you look at my solutions before you solve the problems yourself you're cheating!
