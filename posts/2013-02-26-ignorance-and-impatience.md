title: ignorance and impatience
---

It scares me how little I truly know,  In reading [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://github.com/sarabander/sicp-pdf) I learn cool new things every page.  At the same time, I'm too impatient to sit through it and read every page and learn that before moving on to something else.  I'm in the middle (more like beginning) of reading that, and [Learn you a Haskell for Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) and [Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/) and [Land of Lisp](http://landoflisp.com/) and... probably a dozen other things I forget to mention.  I'm able to start, but never have time to finish.  I feel like I don't know nearly enough...

...and it scares me that my friends regard me as one of the better programmers of the group.
