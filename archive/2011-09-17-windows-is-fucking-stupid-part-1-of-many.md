so i *hate* windows.  yes, *hate* is a very strong word, so i'll say it again, i **HATE** windows!  yes that is exactly how i feel.  and i am not ashamed to say it.  right now i am griping because of its stupidly slow update process.  it is *stupid* how slow it is.  and usually i don't have to worry about it, i don't have to worry at all.  but yesterday i booted into windows (after about 3 months of not being in windows) and there were (of course) a whole lot of updates to do. and that's fine, and to be expected.  what annoys me is how long it took to do the updates!  and then how long it took to shut down after doing the updates, and ZOMG!  how long it took to get **BACK INTO WINDOWS AFTER DOING THE UPDATES BECAUSE IT HAD TO FINISH DOING THE UPDATES!!!!**  and whats worse?  it had to restart my computer and *THEN AND ONLY THEN* after finishing **_MORE_** updates when it was starting up, did i get let into windows...  
  
that is just sad.  on my archlinux computer at work, i didn't do any updates for over a month.  one day i decide to update and `sudo pacman -Syu` in a terminal and forgot about it.  i had 500M of downloads, and it was going to take ~1G of space on my hard drive (apparently KDE just updated a bunch of stuff).  i forgot about the fact that my computer was updating, and didn't even know when it finished updates, or was even reminded that i had updated the next time i got on the computer.  my computer simply did what i asked and got the hell out of my way.  *THAT* is what a computer i supposed to do, that is what *any* decient helper would do.  they do what the master/guru/whatever says, and gets out of his way so he can do his work easily.  do you think painters and architects and other skilled workers want flies buzzing around them all the time while they are trying to work?  *THAT* is what windows is to me, a hoard of flies that constantly buzz around me while i am using my computer.  
  
which is why i am proud to use linux, it lets me get shit done.
