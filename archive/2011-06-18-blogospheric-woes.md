so, i'm making this spiffy new blog for myself right?  and so far it is pretty spiffy.  i mean i'm learning html (kinda), css (sorta), haml & sass (mostly) also i'm learning ruby & shoes.  most of those are prettymuch for getting the site set up and looking pretty.  all of them are really the last two: ruby & shoes (ruby shoes!).  so why is blogging helping me learn ruby?  or shoes for that matter??? (if you're wondering what shoes is go [here][shoes]  well let me describe what it is i'm trying to accomplish and maybe you will be able to understand what is going on.

## ok, so whats up with these ruby shoes you're talking about?? ##

it's not ruby shoes, it's ruby *and* shoes.  there is a difference.  [these][rubyshoes] are ruby shoes (ruby slippers to be exact).  [this][ruby_shoes] is shoes. a GUI DSL for the ruby programming language.  ok, acronyms will be defined then i'm moving on!  sereously!!!

#### GUI: ####
graphical user interface.  that you're (most likely) using right now to view the web and interact with your computer.

#### DSL: ####
domain specific language.  a programming language that is designed for the task at hand.  much like legal jargon, 133t 5p33k, and whatever your math teacher was talking about when he was trying to explain taking the partial differential of the multidimensional cosine and multiplying it by the logarithmic integral of the abtract trigonometric functor process......  or whatever :P

## ok, ok i get it, can we move on now!?!?  ##

yes,f indeed we can.  so  ruby, shoes, coolness, anyway: [jekyll][] the software that does the heavy lifting on my blog, requires *lots* of things to make everything look spiffy.  for instance, the filename of my post must be: YEAR-MO-DY-post-title-of-awesomeness.md also,
