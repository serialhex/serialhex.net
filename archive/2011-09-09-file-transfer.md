after reading this: [xkcd: file transfer](http://xkcd.com/949/) i realized, that
there *is* no cross-platform, easily accessable file-transfer program.  or even a
decient method to transfer files from one person to another.  this is just sad.
the intarwebz has been around for what?  ~50 years now??? (1973 so sayeth [wikipedia][]
so 38 years)  and yes, for he tech-savvy people there are a number of different
ways one can go about sharing files.  setting up ftp servers or having it hosted
on a website of some sort...  i know i can (and have) shared files with people 
via my github account.  though sending an e-mail to my mom in the next room so i
don't have to deal with flaky windows networking & file sharing is, IMO, fscking 
retarted!!  i mean, really?  and if i want to share something with my brother in
NY one or the other has to have an ftp or some such set up...  and that is just
a pain!!  

what to do?  what to do?  maybe make something cool??
