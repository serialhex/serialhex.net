ok, so here are a few tools i am __*totally and completely in love with*__:  

### Sublime Text 2 ###

currently in public alpha (i'm using the latest build #2065) [sublime text 2][] is a *stupid awesome text editor*  it does *everything* one could want a text editor to do.  and it does it simply and elegantly.  and it has *BUNCHES* of highlighting schemas... which has always been a pain for me.  if you're going to do syntax highlighting, i want it to highlight every type of syntax i work with!!  (most FOSS dosn't cut it in this respect... read on!)  i imagine that this is kind of like textmate on OS X but i don't know because textmate is __only__ on OS X (which is *really freaking annoying!!!*).  so if you are looking for a really good text editor, with really nice controls & really spiffy & really easy to use ui, get it!  when i have the $$$ i'm buying myself a license!!! no it's not open source, but it's so cool it doesn't have to be!!!  so go out and get it... NOW!!!

### Yakuake ###

so WTF is [Yakuake][]?? from the [wikipedia article][] it stands for "Yet Another Kuake" apparently after a terminal named Kuake that wanted to emulate Quake's terminal... IDK if it succeeds or not, but i *do* know it's freaking sporty!!! from what i understand it has some features that [gnu screen][] and [tmux][] are good for, which is screen multiplexing.  and with some simple keyboard commands (ex: ctrl-shift-t splits the current console top to bottom, ctrl-shift-l splits it left to right, shift-tab switches to the next terminal on your screen, ctrl-shift-n brings up a new window tab, shift-left\_arrow goes to the tab to the left, and i hope you can figure out what shift-right\_arrow does...)  what's really nice is that *most* of these keyboard commands are common between lots of pre-exsisting applications, so i don't ahve to invest much (if any) time in learning them.  truth to tell... i've only had Yakuake for a few hours and i found out about the screen splitting stuff *on accident* (ctrl-shift-t in konsole gets a new tab... which led me to see my console window split in half)...  

one of the nicer aspects of it though, is that it is a drop-down terminal.  hit F12 and it drops down.  do what you need to in the console. hit F12 again, and it's gone!!  i *LOVE* tools that get the hell out of my way when i'm working!!!  i shouldn't have to *beg* the tool to do what i want it to do, or get out of my way.  (one of the big reasons why i'm not on windows, the whole OS seems to get im my way!!!)
